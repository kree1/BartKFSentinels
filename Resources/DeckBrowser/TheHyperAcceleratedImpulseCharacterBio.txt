When Impulse's best friend Carol was snatched ten centuries into the future by her own adult self, Bart quickly followed, and learned that it was all part of a plan to prevent a dangerous megalomaniac from enslaving the world of the future.

Built from Carol's own designs, President Thawne's hyper-acceleration ray transformed ordinary humans into speedsters, but with awful side effects- the "Hyperguard" were highly suggestible to Thawne's will, and had lifespans measured in months due to accelerated aging.

The adult Carol's plan was simply to remove her younger self from Bart's timeline, preventing her research from coming to pass, but Bart couldn't stand the idea and teamed up with his own future self to engage Thawne's plan directly. In the course of dismantling one of the rays, Impulse was exposed to the beam, enhancing his already fearsome connection to the Speed Force in new and unpredictable ways. Now, he can generate energy duplicates he calls "scouts" which can travel not only through space but time as well, giving him unprecedented insight and access to all of history.

As for whether the timestream can handle the effects of a dozen Impulses at once... that remains to be seen.
