Little is known about the masked crimefighter known as Palmreader. Identity, origins, motives, powerset- even their gender remains unconfirmed. What is certain is their martial prowess.

Their reactions to physical attack suggest average human strength and durability, and they've never been reported using any weapon more advanced than a broom handle. Nevertheless, amateur video recordings have captured the vigilante- identified only by their light blue hood and mask and open-hand chest insignia- weaving effortlessly through crowds of armed street toughs, turning aside powerful blows bare-handed, dispatching foes with single strikes despite significant weight and reach disadvantages, and on one notable occasion, visibly dodging gunfire at short range.

Is it telepathy? Precognition? A lifetime of training? Debates rage in online message boards, and none of those who claim to know the truth seem to agree with each other. Whatever their background, they've taken the streets of Philadelphia under their protection, and enforce their own brand of justice upon thieves, bullies, and corrupt authorities alike. And for some residents, that knowledge is enough.
