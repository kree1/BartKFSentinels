Tessa "TJ" Jelinski lives a dangerous double life, developing Mass Drivers Incorporated's next generation of construction nanotechnology by day and using their resources to fight crime and protect the innocent by night.

She's known since becoming the masked heroine Torrent that she'd have to lie to her friends and coworkers, that she was essentially stealing from the company that had made it possible to pursue her dream in the first place.

It took incredible courage for her to walk into her department head's office one day and announce her secret identity.

She'd convinced herself that she had leverage in this situation, that she could use Torrent's existence as an asset to the company, demonstrating the capabilities of MDI's technology to the public and generating goodwill for the company with her accomplishments. She'd told herself a million times that if they pressed charges, they'd be prosecuting a superhero who'd saved dozens, maybe hundreds of lives, and she could threaten to take her expertise, her off-the-clock advancements, and even her stockpiled nanofleet elsewhere.

The conversation went on for nearly an hour, and conferenced in the vice presidents of research and development and public relations and finally the CEO. When they finally agreed to go forward with her proposal, turning Torrent into an employee and public representative of MDI, TJ's legs nearly gave out with relief.

Naturally, the company had conditions. Chief among them was that the nanobots she used in Torrent's activities never be left in the field while still active- once people knew how Torrent accomplished her feats, other developers would come looking for working samples they could replicate. The stipulation that she regularly "burn out" all her active nanoclusters makes her work a little more dangerous, but it's a small price to pay for peace of mind.
