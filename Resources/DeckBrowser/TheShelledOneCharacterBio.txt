Very little is known for certain about the entity that has been called the Shelled One. Where did it come from? What does it want? What connection does it have to the Forbidden Book? Why its apparent adversarial relationship with the Monitor?

Why change the names of three players to replace "Dan" with "Peanut", and then demand they be worshipped as extensions of itself? Who were the Peanut Cheaters, and what will happen if they are not identified?

Is it responsible for the Debt imposed on Jaylen Hotdogfingers after her return from death, and the resulting incinerations? Is it attempting to "bless" players by encasing them in giant peanut shells, or to punish them? Were its comments on the deliberate shelling of the LA Unlimited Tacos' pitching rotation meant to indicate disapproval, or merely amusement? Why was it so upset over the donation of 100 million total peanuts at the memorials to past players in the Hall of Flame?

Whatever the case, a few things have been established. When challenged, The Shelled One fields its own team, THE SHELLED ONE'S PODS, to face off against the latest blaseball champions. The PODS' players bear familiar names and faces, but show no signs that they recognize any former teammates or rivals. The presence of the Shelled One alters weather conditions, and may change the nature of Blaseball itself- its games do not end at the bottom of the ninth inning, but when one team's Spirit is depleted.

Only one team has ever defeated the PODS- the legendary Hall Stars, captained by the twice-returned Jaylen Hotdogfingers herself. That victory opened the way for the Baltimore Crabs to Ascend to Blaseball 2, but the Hall Stars themselves were Released, never to play again. And though it might seem that the Shelled One, too, is gone for good, there have been troubling omens since then, and many fans suspect that a god does not die so easily...
