Crime may or may not pay, but it sure doesn't like to clean up after itself. When one-of-a-kind serums, inventions, and artifacts are left behind at the scene of the crime, police officers inspect them carefully, catalog the incident and items, and bring them here, along with everything else.

Many of these items gather dust here until the statute of limitations expires and the city can afford to dispose of them... but sometimes a criminal wants their confiscated gear back, or has competitors who'd love to get their hands on the latest secret advancements in mad science. When someone in a mask or cape comes knocking, and the staff of the local evidence storage facility decide they're not up to the task in front of them- that's when the heroes come in to keep those dangerous objects from ending up in another set of the wrong hands.
