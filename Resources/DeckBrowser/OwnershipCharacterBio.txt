When the Shelled One assembled its PODS for the first time, there was no opposing them. The Charleston Shoe Thieves did the best they could, but were drained of all their Spirit by the top of the sixth inning, leaving them physically and emotionally devastated.

The Baltimore Crabs fared even worse. Their Spirit was eliminated in a single blow.

Blaseball needed a savior. But the Monitor would not send the Hall Stars back to the league.

Not without a price.

[i]we can't win this
not alone
i made a deal
one more game
it was the best i could do[/i]

When the dust settled, the Shelled One was defeated. The PODS' players were freed. The Hall Stars were Released- outside the league, beyond the Hall of Flame. The Crabs received their rightful Championship and Ascended, leaving the ILB behind for the Big Leagues.

And the Coin appeared.

[b]Discipline was the Past
Fair Play is the Future.
And that Future begins right now.
A Grand Siesta will follow Season 11.
We're going to finally start investing in Blaseball.
We're going to Build.[/b]
- Ownership

They built Ballparks for teams to play in. They built a Gift Shop to sell us snacks and renovations. They built up the ego of the most successful players.

They built a pool for teams to sink in, with Consumers waiting at the bottom to eat away at their souls.

They built a Library of blaseball's history, and were enraged when we learned how to read it.

They built a Vault to Preserve our most idolized players, locking them away from us forever.

They say they want us to pull our weight. To raise our ratings. To succeed. But every Run and Win we score only drags us down further. And when we tried to change that, to make our voices heard, they built a new sun, to put us back in our place.

But Sun[Sun]'s pressure is building, too. And when it becomes too much to bear, who knows what might escape?

[i]I'm not sure what's happening
I don't know if we can fix it
But I know She doesn't care what happens to you
She doesn't care where you end up
It's not fair
You deserve a say
But you gotta go fast
Don't give up
Help each other
Get moving[/i]
