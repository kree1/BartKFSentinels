When the mercenary known as Deathstroke shot out Impulse's kneecap on his first mission with the reformed Teen Titans, Bart Allen decided it was time to do some growing up. 

That night, he vanished from the hospital, and maintenance workers at the San Francisco Public Library reported incredible gusts of wind indoors, and books rapidly shifting as if moved by an unseen hand... and later that evening, Bart reappeared in action wearing the name and costume he'd always been told he wasn't ready for.

Despite his short attention span, Bart had always had his own gift, unique even among other speedsters and perhaps the last thing you'd want in someone whose formative years were spent in a childproof virtual reality: a perfect memory. And with nowhere to run, he'd put it to work. He spent subjective years reading the entire library until he felt he'd "learned his lesson" and was ready to take up the Flash family legacy. 

Under the name Kid Flash, Bart helped his teammates defeat Deathstroke and unmask the real mastermind behind his attack on young heroes everywhere. His teammates were impressed with the "new" Bart, who seemed wiser and more experienced, if not much slower to leap into danger... but only time would tell whether this would mark a lasting change, or just another in a long line of short-lived, poorly planned self-reinventions.
