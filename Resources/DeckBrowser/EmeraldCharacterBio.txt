Danny Tozer isn't ready to be Dreadnought. She's not even ready to tell her father that she's not the son he thought she was, or that his search for a "cure" for her new, gender-affirming physique is doomed to failure because she has freaking superpowers.

She likes some of the Legion Pacifica. Magma and Doctor Impossible are pretty cool, and Valkyrja completely lives up to her hype. But there's also Carapace, who won't say what's different between her getting her powers and the last two Dreadnoughts who happened to be cis men, and Chlorophyll, who's pretty decent but really wants her signed up so the team can use her as a bargaining chip in budget negotiations, and Graywytch, who- ugh. Google "Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist" yourself, because that's the nicest thing Danny can think of to describe Graywytch.

But going out caping with her friend Calamity is a nice escape from all that, at least for now. Maybe she can't commit to being the world's greatest superhero, but she can at least put on a cape and try to hunt down his killer.
