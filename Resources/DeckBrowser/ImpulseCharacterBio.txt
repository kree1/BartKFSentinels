Bart Allen is the grandson of Barry Allen, the Flash of the Silver Age. Like his father, he inherited the ability to move and react at hypersonic speeds and even change his rate of molecular vibration to pass through solid objects. Unlike his father, these abilities manifested at birth, accelerating his metabolism and his aging. He grew to adolescence in the span of two years, contained in a virtual reality environment that could keep up with him, before his powers could be stabilized enough to introduce him to reality.

When he emerged, Bart found the "real world" had much in common with his previous home- it too was completely devoid of anything that could hurt him, if he put his mind to it. His resulting rash decisions and devil-may-care attitude earned him the name Impulse, and he confused, frustrated, and downright terrified many of his heroic peers and predecessors as he pursued a life of well-meaning adventure.
