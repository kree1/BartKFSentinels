Stephanie Baker isn't ready to call herself Victory. Hell, she isn't even ready to call herself Stephanie, at least where her parents are concerned. Her dad still thinks his "son" was turned into a girl by some mad scientist splashing him with "gender fluid."

But Professor Kaiju did send her this awesome suit that can change color, so she doesn't have to pick a permanent identity yet.

Trying to keep this power totally hidden forever would drive her nuts. She may as well do something good with it, right? Maybe she can even track down whoever killed her predecessor. She doesn't have to be the one who brings them in- just find out enough to report them to the Sentinels of Freedom or somebody.

The last Victory died giving her the gift of a lifetime. A little detective work is the least she can do to pay that back. What's the worst that can happen?
