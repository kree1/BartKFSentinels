Bart Allen has come a long way since the time-shattering event known as the Flashpoint. He's been to the future, the past, other dimensions, other realities... but none of that matters now.* Because now, he's home.

And home is where his friends are. Conner, Cassie, Robin, Cissie... even Max and Jesse are here and safe, after some finagling with the Speed Force. He's even made new friends like Teen Lantern, Sideways, Aqualad, Jinny Hex, and Amethyst, Princess of Gemworld! And Wally West! (Well, this Wally West. It's complicated.)

Oh, and his grandpa is alive? Again?? What???

* OK, maybe it matters a little bit. Maybe a lot. We'll find out, all right!?
