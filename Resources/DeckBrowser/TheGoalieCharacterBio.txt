Gita Bhattacharyya probably shouldn't be alive. She and her brother were walking home one night after soccer practice when a group of Omnitron-IV drones made their way onto the main road of their hometown... and locked on targets.

Gita and Johar ran for it, but when he was pinned under debris from the machines' wildly swinging lasers, she refused to leave him. The drones continued to advance, and suddenly a shimmering translucent wall surrounded Gita and her brother in a whitish rectangle. For a moment she thought they were safe- and then one of the drones' bladed arms reached through the wall. In a panic, she lashed out- and found the world had gone soft around her. She ripped the blade from its body with one hand, without even a scratch on her bare skin, and drove it through the off-balance robot's torso before it could prepare a counterattack. Encouraged by the rush of adrenaline, she stood her ground, deflecting lasers and dismantling the killer drones as they approached, until none remained.

Gita's power lets her designate a rectangular area approximately five by fifteen meters, which she calls the Goalposts. Outside this space she has no powers, but inside, she has superhuman strength, speed, and resistance to injury. Determined to use her abilities to protect people the way she protected her brother that night, she signed up for the Sentinels of Freedom initiative as the impassable Goalie.
