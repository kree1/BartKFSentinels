After months of study at the Sentinels of Freedom Academy into the nature of her powers, Gita had hit a dead end. No matter what she tried, the area her Goalposts would cover wouldn't stretch any further, nor would the time required to summon them to a new location get any shorter. If she wanted to keep improving the reliability of her powers, she needed a new angle.

A training session alongside fellow student Headlong gave her the idea: she might not be able to take her powers everywhere she went, but if she could move quickly and stop on a dime even outside her active range, she could grab enemies and drag them back to the Goalposts with her.

Trading a number of favors with more engineering-minded heroes and fellow students has provided the Goalie with the perfect mobility aid: a pair of boots with supercooled soles that produce a field of intense cold just below her feet, creating just enough ice for her to travel quickly across without posing a hazard to anyone else. Equipped with these, she transforms from a fixed defensive fortification to a highly mobile threat, capable of emerging from her Goalposts like a shot from a cannon and reversing course back to safety just as quickly.

Determined to keep some variation of her hero theme, Gita dubbed these her "ice skates" and devised an alternate, hockey-based costume, and the new Goalie was born! She's even learning the slang.
