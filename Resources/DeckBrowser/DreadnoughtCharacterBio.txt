(For the full story on Dreadnought and Danny, read [i]Dreadnought[/i] and [i]Sovereign[/i] by April Daniels, available now from Diversion Books!)

In February of 1944, an American pilot disappeared into a cloud bank. Two weeks later, he flew back to Allied Command without his plane.

There had been superhumans before, but his new abilities dwarfed anything the world had ever seen. No one could match him for speed, or strength, or durability. They called him Dreadnought, and he was fearless.

The world of superhumans has changed and shifted since the simple days of Axis versus Allies for the fate of the world, but Dreadnought remains. Heroes bearing the name have died, but a successor always appears. The current Dreadnought headlines the Legion Pacifica, defenders of the American west coast, and has held the mantle for over thirty years.

Or at least he had, until he fell out of the sky with a golf-ball-sized hole through his chest.

Dreadnought knew he was done for. He needed to make sure his power didn't die with him, so he gave it to the boy (he thought) who had stepped up. The one who'd ignored his order to flee and helped drag him away from the battle, who'd found somewhere safe to wait for paramedics.

Danny Tozer had been hiding out behind the mall to paint her toenails. In secret, because she couldn't let anyone know that she was a girl born in the wrong body.

Previous Dreadnoughts were square-jawed, broad-shouldered, tall and imposing, their bodies rebuilt by their power to match their personal ideal shape. After the transfer, Danny has the muscle mass and physical fitness of an entire Olympic village, and the build of an airbrushed swimsuit model, with curves in all the places she always wanted.

The first few weeks after the change are daunting. At home, she has to pretend she's on board with her father's plans to "cure" her new body and deal with unwanted advances from her former best friend; in (temporary) costume, she's tugged between the thrill of her powers, the confusion of the caped community, and the threat of the villain who killed her predecessor, still at large.

The world needs Dreadnought.
