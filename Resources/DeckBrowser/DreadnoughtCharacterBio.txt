(For the full story on Dreadnought and Danny, read [i]Dreadnought[/i] and [i]Sovereign[/i] by April Daniels, available now from Diversion Books!)

In February of 1944, an American pilot disappeared into a cloud bank and returned two weeks later- without his plane. There had been superhumans before, but none with the sheer power that he had. No one could match him for speed, or strength, or durability. They called him Dreadnought, after the warship that revolutionized naval warfare at the turn of the century, and he was fearless.

The world of superhumans has changed and shifted since the simple days of Axis versus Allies for the fate of the world- but Dreadnought remains. Individuals die- the first facing would-be conqueror Mistress Malice, the second in the Kaiju Crisis of 1985- but someone new always rises to the challenge. The current Dreadnought headlines the Legion Pacifica, defenders of the American west coast, and has held the mantle for over thirty years. Or at least he had, until he fell out of the sky with a golf-ball-sized hole in his chest.

He landed next to the out-of-the-way spot where Danny Tozer was painting her toenails. In secret. Because she couldn't let anyone know that she was a girl, but she couldn't bear living without asserting her identity somehow. Even in a way no one would ever see.

Dreadnought knew he was done for. He needed to make sure his power didn't die with him- so he gave it to the boy (he thought) who had refused to flee and dragged him somewhere safe to wait for paramedics.

Previous Dreadnoughts were square-jawed, broad-shouldered, tall and imposing- their bodies rebuilt by their power to match their personal ideal shape. Danny has the muscle mass and physical fitness of an entire Olympic village, and the shape of an airbrushed swimsuit model, with curves in all the places she always wanted.

The first few weeks after the change are daunting. At home, she has to pretend she's on board with her father's plans to "cure" her new body and deal with unwanted advances from her former best friend; in (temporary) costume, she's tugged between the mixed bag that is Dreadnought's former teammates, the thrill of her powers, and the threat of the villain who killed her predecessor, still at large.

The world needs Dreadnought.
