Certain scholars have noticed a pattern repeating throughout history.

* An individual distinguishes themself in some way: it could be athletic or intellectual skill, dedication to a craft or calling, or an unyielding sense of some particular virtue such as justice or loyalty.

* Through talent, practice, luck, or some combination of factors, the individual rises to the peak among practitioners of their chosen discipline.

* A man, unknown to the individual or anyone around them but always carrying a pistol, greets the individual and offers them a challenge. It may be armed or unarmed combat, or something more specific to their field of excellence. The individual accepts the challenge.

* The stranger wins, and upon winning, shoots the loser dead. No reliable record is available of what happened to the stranger afterward.

It happened to Alexander the Great, Napoleon Bonaparte, and George S. Patton. It's happened to Olympic athletes, to crusading knights, to legendary sheriffs and outlaws, to masters of martial arts. On at least one occasion, it's happened to a chess champion. More extraordinarily, it's also happened to people who were relative unknowns at the time of their passing- individuals whose contributions to their fields, while brilliant, would only become famous after their sudden deaths prompted other, more widely acknowledged experts to reexamine their work and find the genius within.

The killer leaves hardly any evidence- no bullets are recovered, no fingerprints are found at the scene- but there are enough witness accounts to put together a description, and the picture is consistent. A tanned man in a wide-brimmed hat and poncho, carrying two pistols, usually offering some words of acknowledgment for his target's great deeds before issuing the challenge. Never a name, or a history, or a legacy of his own.

So, what stands alone after the fall of a legendary figure? What endures unchanged despite the passing of centuries? What stands in the shadow of giants and raises them to greatness?

The few historians who've put together enough pieces to be sure of this man's existence refer to him as "Memorial."
